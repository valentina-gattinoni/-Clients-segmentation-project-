# -Clients-segmentation-project-
Several unsupervised learning techniques are tested in order to  segment clients data from a bank. The dataset BankClients.xlsx contains samples related to as many clients. 
A total of features, both categorical and numerical, describe the clients. PCA and t-SNE are exploited to inspect data, and different clustering techniques (e.g. k-medoids, DBSCAN, OPTICS, GMM) are employed, showing interesting results.
